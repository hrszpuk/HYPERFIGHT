## HYPERFIGHT
So, I wanted to make a a fork of HYPERFIGHT with a few newer features:
- Port to Godot 4
- Built-in Palette Editor
- MMR (ELO based?)
- Better lobbies
  - Roles (owner, mod, etc)
  - Better lobby management:
    - Kicking players
    - Force skipping players
    - Muting players
    - Automatically assign new owner if owner leaves
    - Change lobby settings without ending lobby
  - Lobby stats
    - Wins / Loses (per player)
    - Average delay (per player)
    - Lobby average delay
